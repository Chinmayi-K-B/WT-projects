# Assignment 4 – Movie Search App (React)

## Name
Movie Search App (Evaluation 3)

## Description
This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using React that allows users to search for movies using a third-party API. The application dynamically fetches and displays movie data without page reloads.

## Technologies Used
- React
- CSS
- OMDb API

## Features
- React Hooks (useState)
- Dynamic rendering of movie data
- API-based search functionality
- Single Page Application behavior

## Challenges
Managing component state and handling asynchronous API requests were the primary challenges. Proper error handling and loading state management were implemented.

## Reflection
This assignment helped me improve my understanding of component-based architecture in React. I learned how to manage state using hooks and handle asynchronous operations efficiently.

## Run Instructions
npm install  
npm run dev  

## Demo
The application was tested locally and successfully demonstrates dynamic data fetching and rendering using a third-party API.
